![CAD design for shelf]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/week-6/shelves-cad.png){: .small}

This week I'm going practical and making a shelf for my home bathroom. The bathroom is... cozy, and shared by five people. Currently, we have a shoe rack to store all our bathroom things, which also blocks off the towel rack. If we get something to function as bathroom storage, this means we can reclaim the shoe rack to store five people's boots and shoes (which is particularly useful as winter slush, salt, and sand approaches). But it also turns out that it's hard to get something that fits in this small awkward space. So I'll make something!

I'm also interested in woodworking, so I wanted to try out making some form of traditional joinery with a CNC machine. The simplest candidate here for a beginner is a box joint. Conveniently, the shelves I am interested in making are rather boxy. Per Rob's recommendation, it's best to start simple on the ShopBot in general. I also ended up getting really sick for most of this week, which really cut into my time on this. Luckily, I had started designing this week's assignment in CAD before I got sick.

I got really interested in some of the more complicated joinery shown [here](https://mkmra2.blogspot.com/2014/08/cnc-cut-wood-joinery.html), but there was no way I was attempting that on this time scale, or on oriented strand board.
